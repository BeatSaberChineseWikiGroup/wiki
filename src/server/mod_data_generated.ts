However, a wide range of sabers are still completely functional and it is up to the saber creators to update the shaders they used if they are broken.\n\nTo read more about migrating sabers to the newer versions of Beat Saber, read [this wiki page](https://bsmg.wiki/models/shader-migration.html).\n\nYou can enable multi-pass rendering to make a majority of old models work again, with a small performance cost. If you haven't done this already, you can find it in-game by navigating to \n\n- Settings -> Mod Settings -> Asset Bundles, \n\nthen enabling the multi-pass toggle.\n\n# Custom Sabers Lite\n\nCustomSabersLite is a minimal-feature custom sabers mod, which aims to provide a user-friendly experience without overwhelming players with too many settings and menus; people who were used to the original CustomSabers may find this mod preferable over the alternatives. This mod allows you to load .saber files from [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Sabers/?pc) and .whacker files from [Qosmetics](https://bsmg.wiki/models/custom-sabers.html#quest-sabers) and replace the default sabers with them.\n\nCredit to the original [Custom Sabers](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/CustomSaberPlugin) mod and its contributors, which was the basis for this mod's creation.\n\nOlder versions of CustomSabersLite are not supported. If you find issues using an older version then I won't be able to help.\n\n## Adding Sabers and Changing Settings\n\nSettings are set in-game from the left panel in the Custom Sabers menu. This is accessed by clicking the `Custom Sabers` button on the left of the main menu.\n\nYou can find the custom sabers folder by pressing the \"open folder\" button inside the Custom Sabers menu, which will open the folder on your computer. Alternatively, you can navigate to your game's installation directory and, after launching the game once, you will find the `CustomSabers` folder there. Place `.saber` or `.whacker` files in this folder.\n\nYou can also adjust settings by clicking the Mods tab at the top of the gameplay settings menu to the left of the song list, then clicking the Custom Sabers tab.\n", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/CustomSabersLite.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 307}, "customwalls": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "CustomWalls", "game_ver": ["1.37.4", "1.37.5", "1.38.0", "1.39.0", "1.39.1", "1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://github.com/qqrz997/BeatSaberCustomWalls"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["qqrz997"], "desc_en": "A plugin for custom walls in Beat Saber", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/CustomWalls.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 110}, "datapuller": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "DataPuller", "game_ver": ["1.38.0", "1.39.0", "1.39.1", "1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://github.com/DJDavid98/BSDataPuller"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["Double Colon"], "desc_en": "A similar mod to HttpStatus with some extra features such as BSR code and player health", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/DataPuller.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 134}, "discordcore": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "DiscordCore", "game_ver": ["1.37.4", "1.37.5", "1.38.0", "1.39.0", "1.39.1", "1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://github.com/DJDavid98/DiscordCore"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["Double Colon"], "desc_en": "A utility/library for easily doing Discord management for mods and handling priority between rich presence systems.", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/DiscordCore.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 157}, "ditails": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "DiTails", "game_ver": ["1.38.0", "1.39.0", "1.39.1", "1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://github.com/Auros/DiTails/"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["qe201020335"], "desc_en": "# DiTails\nView extra details about a map\n* View Cover Art (in a larger image)\n* View Song Hash\n* View the BeatSaver description\n* Open the BeatSaver page in your browser\n* Vote in the menu!", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/DiTails.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 184}, "dynamic bone": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "Dynamic Bone", "game_ver": ["1.36.0", "1.36.2", "1.37.0", "1.37.1", "1.37.2", "1.37.3", "1.37.4", "1.37.5", "1.38.0", "1.39.0", "1.39.1", "1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dynamic-bone-16743"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["nicoco007"], "desc_en": "Applies physics to character's bones or joints.\n\nThis mod was imported from BeatMods, and was originally uploaded by nicoco007 at 2024-04-19T21:27:22.065Z.", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/Dynamic Bone.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 319}, "easyoffset": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "EasyOffset", "game_ver": ["1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://github.com/Reezonate/EasyOffset"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["Reezonate"], "desc_en": "Intuitive controller offset adjustment tool.

So just keeping NoFail active in Practice and using this button to watch the replay also fixes that \ud83d\ude42\n\n![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/cGOelJA.png)\n\n## Credits\nThank you [Kinsi](https://github.com/kinsi55) for creating the original mod (and the above description)!", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/FailButton.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 339}, "ffmpeg": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "FFmpeg", "game_ver": ["1.13.4", "1.14.0", "1.16.1", "1.16.2", "1.16.3", "1.17.0", "1.17.1", "1.18.0", "1.18.2", "1.19.0", "1.19.1", "1.20.0", "1.21.0", "1.23.0", "1.24.1", "1.25.1", "1.26.0", "1.26.1", "1.26.2", "1.27.0", "1.28.0", "1.29.0", "1.31.0", "1.31.1", "1.32.0", "1.33.0", "1.34.0", "1.34.2", "1.34.5", "1.34.6", "1.35.0", "1.36.2", "1.37.0", "1.37.1", "1.37.3", "1.38.0", "1.39.0", "1.39.1", "1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["Kevga"], "desc_en": "FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created.", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/FFmpeg.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 196}, "final ik": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "Final IK", "game_ver": ["1.36.0", "1.36.2", "1.37.0", "1.37.1", "1.37.2", "1.37.3", "1.37.4", "1.37.5", "1.38.0", "1.39.0", "1.39.1", "1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/final-ik-14290"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["nicoco007"], "desc_en": "The final Inverse Kinematics solution for Unity.\n\nThis mod was imported from BeatMods, and was originally uploaded by nicoco007 at 2024-04-19T21:26:42.419Z.", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/Final IK.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 318}, "fpscounter": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "FPSCounter", "game_ver": ["1.37.4", "1.37.5", "1.38.0", "1.39.0", "1.39.1", "1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://github.com/Loloppe/FPSCounter"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["Loloppe"], "desc_en": "A Beat Saber mod to show your fps in-game", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/FPSCounter.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 334}, "gottagofast": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "GottaGoFast", "game_ver": ["1.37.4", "1.37.5", "1.38.0", "1.39.0", "1.39.1", "1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://github.com/kinsi55/CS_BeatSaber_GottaGoFast"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["Kinsi"], "desc_en": "Significantly decreases the time it takes to (re)start and leave songs in Beat Saber", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/GottaGoFast.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 279}, "hapticstweaker": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "HapticsTweaker", "game_ver": ["1.39.1", "1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://github.com/BlqzingIce/HapticsTweaker"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["BlqzingIce"], "desc_en": "**Features:**\n- Fully customize the haptic duration and strength of Normal Notes, Chain Heads, Chain Links/Elements, Bad Cuts, Bombs, Arcs, Saber Clashes, and Wall Clashes!\n- Arcs and clashes do not have a duration as they are continuous.  \n\n**Likely not compatible with any mods that modify haptics.

It doesn't even matter if you create new folders in that folder, HSV will still be able to find them all.\n\nHaving dropped your config files in the folder doesn't mean you're ready to go yet as you still need to select it in-game. It's pretty straight-forward to do so, but follow the steps below if you really want to be sure.\n\n1) You'll need to start up Beat Saber, however, you don't have to restart it to add new configs\n2) Select HitScoreVisualizer in the mod list on the left side of the main menu\n3) Choose your desired config and press the \"select\" button\n\nAs you might have noticed, each config has a text below its name that describes it current state. You can find all the possible config states in the table below.\n\n| State (internal) | Text shown in-game                                 | Description                                                                                                                                      |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Broken           | Invalid config. Not selectable...                  | Means that the file cannot be loaded, it's either not a valid HSV config file or not a config file at all.                                       |\n| Incompatible     | Config is too old. Targets version {Version}       | The config is too old and therefore can't be migrated to the newer format automagically.                                                         |\n| ValidationFailed | Validation failed, please check the file again.    | You made an error in the config itself, you can check the logs to see what might be wrong (will be logged as a warning).                         |\n| NeedsMigration   | Config made for HSV {Version}. Migration possible. | The config is valid, but still needs a migration to the newer format, this can be done automagically though.                                     |\n| Compatible       | OK - {Version}                                     | The config file is just fine, nothing special needs to happen. Shows the version for which it was originally made.                               |\n| NewerVersion     | Config is too new. Targets version {Version}       | The config file is made for a newer version of HSV and therefore won't be allowed to be loaded in as it's correct workings cannot be guaranteed. |\n\n### Config migration remark\n\nIf one of your configs needed migration upon selection. The old config will automagically be backed up to the folder `UserData\\HitScoreVisualizer\\Backups` (will be created if it doesn't exist) and the migrated config will be saved to the original file instead.\n\nHowever, all configs placed in that folder will **NOT** be loaded by HSV. This behavior is by-design and is intended as a safety measure, to prevent accidental migration issues with backups.\nIf you want revert to a backup, move one of the files back to the main folder (or another folder in the main folder if you're using a folder structure.)\n\n## Editing Configs\n\nWhen first running the game, it will create a default config which can be found at `UserData\\HitScoreVisualizer\\HitScoreVisualizerConfig-default.json`. Use that file as a starting point, in case you want to customize it. If you do start with this config, make sure to set `isDefaultConfig` to `false`.\n\nThe full rundown on the features of a HitScoreVisualizer config can be found in the main README on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/ErisApps/HitScoreVisualizer?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-config-aka-config-explained).", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/HitScoreVisualizer.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 40}, "hitsoundtweaks": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "HitsoundTweaks", "game_ver": ["1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://github.com/GalaxyMaster2/HitsoundTweaks"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["GalaxyMaster2"], "desc_en": "Adds more configurability to hitsounds, and fixes several base game bugs to make them more reliable and consistent.", "editpath": "src/server/mod_db/pc/HitsoundTweaks.json", "name_zh": null, "beatmods_id": 272}, "hsvlayer": {"platform": "pc", "modPage": null, "name": "HSVLayer", "game_ver": ["1.37.4", "1.37.5", "1.38.0", "1.39.0", "1.39.1", "1.40.0", "1.40.1", "1.40.2", "1.40.3", "1.40.4", "1.40.5", "1.40.6", "1.40.7", "1.40.8"], "desc_zh": null, "extern_links": ["https://github.com/Loloppe/BeatSaber_HSVLayer"], "iscore": false, "authors": ["Loloppe"], "desc_en": "Allow the user to change the display layer of the score text that display when you cut a note.
